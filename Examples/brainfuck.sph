 #> Explanations:
 #   - "currchar: string @ @input" just means: string variable named "currchar" at the location of variable named "input"
 #   - "| len = 1" just sets a property of len (length) to 1 where "|" tells the compiler that a property is being set 
 #     it is differenciated betewen Bitwise Or and Property Definition/Assignment based on its Left-Hand-Side type check (wether LHS is an Identifier or not)
 #             
 # 
 # Fun Fact: Sphere was first conceptualized as a language named "Hellmo" - A language inspired by Brainfuck and Assembly. 
 #           The language was going to be written purely from hex numbers which then later on became Sphere.
 #           Hellmo: https://github.com/NullifyDev/Hellmo

# COMPILATION CONDITION GUARD(S)
# Tells the compiler "if Sphere is earlier than v1.1, return (do not run)"
Sphere { 
    if Sphere.Version > 1.1: ret
